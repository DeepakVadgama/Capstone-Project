Her parents died when she was very young. So, she grew up under the care of her grandfather, who was a great devotee of Shr?krushna, an incarnation of Shr?vishnnu. One day, a Saint gave young Meera a statue of Shrikrushna. Thereafter, Meera spent most of her time playing with the idol and eventually, developed tremendous devotion for Shrikrushna.\n\nWhen Meera grew older, she was married to Prince Bhoj of Mewad, India. Unfortunately, she became a widow soon after the marriage. After the death of her husband, Meera spent most of her time singing hymns and devotional songs praising Shrikrushna. She would chant His Name day and night. Sadly, her intense devotion for Shrikrushna upset her in-laws. So one day, they placed a snake among the flowers she used for her daily worship offering. During the worship, Meera was so lost in her devotion to Shrikrushna that she failed to notice the poisonous snake. But, when Meera put her hand in the flower basket the snake instantly turned into a garland! Thus, Shrikrushna protected His devotee. The miracle perplexed Meera's in-laws but did not stop them from continuing in their efforts to upset her devotion. Soon afterwards, Meera's in-laws gave her a glass of milk containing poison. This time, however, Meera knew about their plan and prayed to Shrikrushna, \"O Shrikrushna, I do not fear death, but I am unhappy because I would not be able to serve you any more.\" So saying, she drank the poisoned milk. However, while drinking it Meera felt as if she was drinking Amrut (the Divine Nectar of Life)! As a result of her intense devotion unto Shrikrushna, the poison did not affect her at all! Seeing Meera alive after this incident, her in-laws realised what a great devotee she was and never harassed her again."));

When he returned he didn’t find his wife there, she had gone to her father’s place with her brother who visited in the absence of Tulsi Das. This made Tusli Das very sad. He was unable to bear the separation. He just could not sleep and live without his wife. His passionate became so uncontrollable that he at once set out for his father-in-law’s house. He walked a long distance in the dark, through wind and rain, just to be with her. On the way he found a swollen river in the dark. But he jumped into the river and swam across it. He mistakenly took a dead body for a boat to cross the swollen river. After crossing it he reached at his father-law’s home. But he found all the doors closed there.ince his wife's room was on the upper floor, he had to climb in order to reach her room. Taking a python to be a thick rope, he scaled it and slipped into his wife's room. Wife awoke at that moment. Tulsidas Goswami said I have had to walk ten miles, in order to come for you. He expected his wife to be happy to see him and hear him. But instead, she was so ashamed of his insane attachment to her that she replied, “Yamuna is full of flood. I can not understand how you were able to enter the house” Tulsidas replied “Your love for me is so great that you threw a rope.” Ratnavali wondered to hear that. She had full confidence on her husband that he never said false. So she herself became anxious for knowing the reality behind that happening. Ratnavali said to her husband Tulsidas “My body is but a network of flesh and bones. If you would develop for Lord Rama even half the love that you have for my filthy body, you would certainly cross the ocean of Samsara and attain immortality and eternal bliss like a great saint.” Those words came as a shock to Tulsidas, a blow to his ego, and he himself must have felt extremely ashamed of his unintelligent and foolish attachment to her. He said to himself: \"what a fool I have been all these years! I loved my wife with all my heart. But why should I have done so? I should have set my heart on something higher. I should have devoted my life to Rama.\""));
