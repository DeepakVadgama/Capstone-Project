## Description 

This app is for all people who want to progress spiritually by doing bhakti (devotion) to Radhe Krishna. 

All saints have given a single message of loving God. But attaching the mind to the Divine is difficult. We are always busy and stressed in this material world performing our duties and the knowledge of this spiritual path is dispersed and sometimes confusing. This app will provide you with clear understanding of path of love. It will help you increase your attachment to God by telling you about God’s engrossing tales known as leelas. It will inspire you with quotes of saints and will help you practice devotion by participating in chantings. 

This app provides:

- Inspirational Quotes from Saints like Tulsidas, Swami Vivekanand, Kabir etc.
- Photos of Radhe Krishna and other Hindu deities like Shiva, Ram, Hanuman etc.
- Engrossing Stories/Leelas of God’s incarnations like Krishna, Ram etc
- Videos of Kirtans/Chantings
- Videos of Lectures given by Saints and their disciples
- Ability to search for information of specific saints or deities
- Ability to save work/art of your favorite saint or deity.

Note: This app does not endorse or condemn any religion or belief. It simply provides people inspiration towards the goal of loving God (in this case, God’s form of Radha and Krishna). We believe in message of One-God-many-forms and would love to keep adding more content to this app to help everyone.
